This is the README file for OurNet::FuzzyIndex, an inverted search
engine for double-byte characters, by The Elixir Initiative and
OurInternet Inc.

* Installation

OurNet::FuzzyIndex uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on Win32 and without a compiler, please use the pre-
compiled binaries at http://melix.elixus.org/ instead.

After installation, type "fianjmo" in your command prompt for
an interactive chat in Traditional Chinese (zh_TW.Big5), which
comes with the bundled OurNet::ChatBot module.

The "fzindex" and "fzquery" are simple utility commands that
generates and queries a full-text index db, respectively. Enter

perldoc fzindex
perldoc fzquery

For examples and usage.
